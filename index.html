                                        administrative scripting, I never stopped coding. In those early days, I was
                                        writing some very sophisticated (and hundreds-of-lines long) DOS batch files. I
                                        also began learning HTML and building for the nascent World Wide Web.

                                        Solaris OS, and acquired a Sun SparcStation as my daily driver at work. Java
                                        had begun to make inroads as the programming language of the Web, and it was on
                                        track to be an even bigger deal when Apple released its new Unix-based OS, so
                                        it became my primary language at that time.

                                        that would allow people to register for a church function. I used CGI and
                                        Python to provide the middle tier and back end logic, and created a custom,
                                        flat-file database to store the entries. I used CSS to style the site and to
                                        create well-formatted printouts that could be used at the event to verify the
                                        people who had preregistered.

                                        <strong>PowerShell 1.0 released.</strong> Python had been my primary scripting
                                        language for getting administrative things done. It ran on Windows, macOS, and
                                        all flavors of UNIX/Linux. PowerShell was a game changer, in that it gives
                                        scripts direct, real-time access to .NET. My script coding transitioned
                                        increasingly to PowerShell, particularly with the open source, cross-platform
                                        releases. It has become an essential part of my teaching in Exchange, Microsoft
                                        365, and Azure administration classes.

                                        <strong>Time for a reboot.</strong> I continued coding over the years, despite
                                        it not being my primary job. I wrote novelties and utilities in Ruby, Python,
                                        and PowerShell. I created software for UNIX, Windows, and Palm OS. I
                                        contributed to open-source projects for mainstream and niche operating systems.
                                        I write things for me, my family members, or friends when the need arises. But
                                        now I want to go back to my roots, to code again like I did in the eighties,
                                        when I worked with a team of like-minded high schoolers turning out platformers
                                        and text adventures for the Apple II. Or writing hacking tools for my friends
                                        and their Commodore 64s. I just get a kick out of programming.

                            Like many kids of the eighties, I got my start with personal computers programming the
                            early eight-bit micros. It's what you had to do; most computers didn't come with a large
                            selection of ready-made software. If you wanted to really <em>use</em> your computer, you
                            had to learn to <em>program</em> your computer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That wasn't a hardship. Many of us found that we had an aptitude for programming and
                            enjoyed solving the puzzles new projects presented. We wanted to learn and showcase new
                            skills, making games, music, and business software, and having fun in the process.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Of course, we can never tell how things will turn out. One path leads to another, and we
                            often find our way back with great difficulty, or not at all. In the words of Robert Frost:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br />
                            Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br />
                            I doubted if I should ever come back.
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>
                            However, after twenty-eight years training IT professionals, I've decided to dust off the
                            old skills, learn some new ones, and get back to the road not taken. It's been a while, and
                            things have changed a bit in the four decades since I got my first computer. But I feel
                            almost like I'm returning to an old homestead and familiar friends. Let's see what the next
                            few decades will bring.
