                        Your goal is to traverse the jungles of South America, in search of the lost city of the
                        dead&nbsp;â€” the ancient Necropolis of a little known branch of the Inca. Rumor has it that some
                        of these tribesman still exist today, and jealously guard their secrets with beastly
                        adroitness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You must take on the role of one of the greatest adventurers of all time and, using the skills
                        you've honed from years of tracking and hunting, and numerous movie and video game appearances,
                        locate the Necropolis and extract the golden head of Ocxaloc, king of the Inca, from the throne
                        room where it is enshrined. But beware your rival archaeologist; he, too, is on the trail of
                        the golden statue. You must defeat him to return alive.

                        Use the heads-up display to keep track of your character's health, weapons, ammunition, and
                        location. With this information, you'll always be ready to make the best decision for any
                        situation.

                    <p>
                        Select the best weapon for your skills. Each persona has weapons that they are particularly
                        adept with. Indy's awesome with a whip, Lara is deadly with her knives, Allan is an expert
                        marksman, and Harry has a boomstick. It's pretty effective.
